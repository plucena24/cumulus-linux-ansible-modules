##ABOUT

Cumulus Linux is Linux so Ansible works right out of the box.  However Cumulus Networks has created several modules to reduce complexity of Ansible playbooks and reduce need for jinja templating.  In addition to github the Cumulus Networks Ansible Library is hosted on the Ansible Galaxy website under the role [CumulusLinux](https://galaxy.ansible.com/list#/roles/1875).


## OVERVIEW OF MODULES
- cl_img_install — Install a different version of Cumulus Linux in the inactive slot.
- cl_interface — Configures a front panel, bridge or bond interface on a Cumulus Linux switch.
- cl_license — Install a Cumulus Linux license. 
- cl_prefix_check - Check to see if a route exists.
- cl_quagga_ospf - Configures basic OSPFv2 global parameters and OSPFv2 interface configuration.
- cl_quagga_protocol - Enable Quagga services available on Cumulus Linux.
